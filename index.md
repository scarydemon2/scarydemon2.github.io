### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

## Projects

### Project 1: Multi-modal Tagging System
![[Octocat]](figure/multimodal-loss.jpg)
<img src="figure/STE.jpg" alt="STE" style="width:400px;height:400px;">


- Selected the optimal base model and architecture through a thorough comparison and evaluation of different alternatives.
- Constructed high-quality training data using PySpark and Hive SQL techniques.
- Trained a multi-modal tagging model and devoloped a recursive algorithm to determine the appropriate threshold, achieving an impressive 90% accuracy

### Project 2: Vertical domain Large-scale Language Model 

- Conducted extensive research on open-source training methodologies, including parameter efficient training (PEFT), full fine-tuning
(FT), and RLHF training.
- Collected a diverse range of open-source training datasets and explored data creation techniques.
- Investigated various base models and compared their features.
- Trained domain-specific LLMs using diffe

### project 3: Counterfeit Brand Titles Detection System
- Performed a comprehensive problem analysis and proposed a modular system architecture to decouple and solve various challenges.
- Employed traditional algorithms, including edit distance, minimum window substring, and recursive algorithm combined with the
CV2 library to calculate
