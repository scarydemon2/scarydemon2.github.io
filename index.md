### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

## Projects

### Project 1: Image Classification using CNNs

- Developed a deep learning model for image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Used PyTorch and trained the model on a GPU cluster.

### Project 2: Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data

- Analyzed a dataset of tweets to predict the sentiment of each tweet (positive, negative, or neutral).
- Used natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to build the model.
- Achieved an accuracy of 85% on a test set.
- Developed a web application to visualize the results.
